      <p>
        To submit changes to OpenJMS, raise a
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=54559&amp;atid=474136">
          bug report
        </a>
        or 
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=54559&amp;atid=474139">
          enhancement request
        </a>
        , and add the changes as an attachment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes should be presented in the form of input to the 
        <strong>patch</strong> command.
      </p>
      <p>
        The patch should be created by using the <strong>cvs diff -u</strong> 
        command. It is recommended that you submit patches against the latest
        CVS version of OpenJMS in order to avoid conflicts. This will also
        ensure that you are not submitting a patch for a problem that has 
        already been resolved. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: 
        <source>
cvs diff -u Foo.java >> patch.txt
        </source>
      </p>
      <p>
        All patches necessary to address an action item should be 
        concatenated within a single patch file. If later modification to 
        the patch proves necessary, the entire new patch should be attached
        and not just the difference between the two patches.
